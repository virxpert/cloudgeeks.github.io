<IMG SRC="images/history1.jpg" ALT="Delhi Fort" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" width="237" height="152">Delhi,
        where a empire rose and fell before the dawn of history; where citadels
        of emperors appeared and disappeared; a city of mysterious eternity
        whose old ruins proclaim a majestic and imperial past and whose present
        pulsates vibrantly with the ever flowing life of India. The eternal
        Jamuna bears witness to the glorious and tumultuous 5,000 year old
        history of Delhi. A history which begins with the creation of
        Indraprastha by the Pandavas and the transformation of this barren gift
        of the Kauravas into an idyllic haven.</FONT><BR>
         <BR>
        <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="times new roman">A history which encompasses all the
        various kings and emperors who fixed their royal citadels here--
        Indraprastha, Lal Kot, Quila Rai Pithora, Siri, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad,
        Ferozabad, Dinpanah, Delhi Sher Shahi or then Shahjahanabad. but,
        combined and integrated into one, these 'new cities' have always been
        called Delhi and howsoever many names it may have acquired, Delhi has
        always been intrinsically identified with power and imperial sway. There
        have been at least eight cities around modern Delhi, and the old saying
        that whoever founds a new city at Delhi will lose it has come true every
        time -- most recently for the British who founded New Delhi in 1911.</FONT></p>

        <IMG SRC="images/history2.jpg" ALT="Jama Masjid" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" width="239" height="154"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="times new roman">The
        historic Purana Qila, which has stood witness to Delhi's rejuvenation,
        periods of anarchy, and the rise &amp; fall of empires, brings alive
        history of the capital. Amidst the tranquility of the splendidly
        panoramic environs of Purana Qila, Delhi's historic and legendary past
        come to life. After Shah Jahan built Red Fort the attention of
        administration shifted to gorgeous palaces of the fort. Today the fort
        is open for the public but only limited area can be accessed. More than
        half of the fort area has been taken over by the Army. But even what is
        open to visit reminds one of the splendour and lavish life style which
        our rulers lived. Delhi has seen the death of many empires and resisted
        bloody attempts to eliminate her. Nadir Shah had ordered his soldiers to
        plunder and massacre Delhi. It is said that he got so much wealth from
        Delhi that he was not able to carry in home. Abdali and Taimur Lane were
        no different they had tried their best to demolish the city of Delhi but
        it was some kind of a boon which helped it to regain its lost glory each
        time Delhi was plundered.</FONT><BR>
         <BR>
        <IMG SRC="images/history3.jpg" ALT="Old Fort" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" width="240" height="155"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="times new roman">Delhi
        was the focal point for the first war of independence in 1857. Though
        the revolt did not reach its desired conclusion, Delhi became a thorn in
        the eyes of the British. Not only in ancient times or the mediaeval
        period, Delhi has been the center of any activity at all times. As the
        Britishers shifted their capital from Calcutta to Delhi, all the
        activities during the freedom struggle were directed towards Delhi.
        Thus, Delhi also bears the marks of the freedom struggle. The ultimate
        goal of the Azad Hind Fauz during the freedom struggle was to capture
        Delhi and established Swaraj. The slogan 'Dilli Chalo' is still used by
        leaders and political parties when they oraganise any rally or
        demonstration. It was the hosting of the tricolour at Red Fort in Delhi
        which marked a chapter in the history of India.</FONT><BR></h4>
